## The Task
How can the US government and hospitals to better amnage and prepare their resources and healthcare personnel?
Covid-19 has stressed hospitals and healthcare workers. We want to tackle this problem with ML that would predict how many inpatients beds are used and available in a typical week according to the State and the City. 
- if we can understand which hospitals/other categories are most stressed with work and predict with ML, we can improve the quality of healthcare by distributing the work.
